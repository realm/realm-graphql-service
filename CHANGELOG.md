# NEXT RELEASE

### Enhancements
* Schema cache will be preemptively invalidated if the Realm is open while the schema change takes place. You still need
to manually invalidate it if you change the schema of a Realm that is not open by the GraphQL service.

### Bug fixes
* The Realm schema will be properly updated after cache invalidation.
